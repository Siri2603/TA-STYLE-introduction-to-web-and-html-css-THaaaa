        The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language
        for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be
        assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and
        scripting languages such as JavaScript.

        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
        describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language
        such as HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web,
        alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]

      <p class="content">
        CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content,
        including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve
        content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the
        specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages
        to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css
        file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content
        as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load
        speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
